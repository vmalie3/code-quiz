## Description

I've created a quiz by utilizing javascript event listeners, if statements, functions, objects, arrays, etc. This quiz includes a start button, answer choice buttons, a timer, and a message which returns your score after completion.


I added some light CSS to make it more visually appealing, however I have not had enough time to be more thorough with the visual design aspect.


I still must work on troubleshooting my code to store the names and scores both locally and on the page.


I also created a penalty of 5 points (5 seconds) for incorrect answers, and a reward of 5 points for correct answers.
